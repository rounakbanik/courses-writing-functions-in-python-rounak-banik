In the previous lessons, we briefly recapped Python's built-in functions and learnt how to define, call and document our own functions.
In this video, we will dive a little deeper into the various kinds of arguments that can be passed into a function. More specifically, we will discuss positional, keyword and default arguments.


---
## Positional Arguments

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "584bf0bfdf"
```

`@part1`
- Arguments are mapped to the function's parameters based on the order in which they are passed. {{1}}
- Positional Arguments are order dependent. {{2}}
- The first argument passed into the function call is mapped to the first parameter in the function definition. The second argument is mapped to the second parameter and so on...{{3}}


`@script`
Positional arguments are those that are mapped to the function's parameters based on the order in which they are passed. Therefore, these arguments are order dependent.
The first argument is mapped to the first parameter. The second argument to the second parameter and so on...


---
## Example: Positional Arguments

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "d333f11529"
```

`@part1`
```python
# Print the arguments passed into the function
def print_arg(a, b):
   print("The value of a is: " + str(a))
   print("The value of b is: " + str(b))
```{{1}}

```python
# Call print_arg using positional arguments
print_arg(3, "Bella")
```{{2}}

```
Output:
The value of a is: 3
The value of b is: Bella
```{{3}}


`@script`
In this example, we have defined a function called print_arg that simply prints out the arguments passed into the function and the parameters to which they are mapped.
Now, let us call print_arg by passing in 3 and Bella as arguments, in that order. We see from the output that the function has mapped the first argument 3 to the first parameter 'a' and consequently, the second argument Bella to the second parameter 'b'.


---
## Keyword Arguments

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "2edad03845"
```

`@part1`
- Arguments are mapped using the parameter names from the function definition.{{1}}
- Keyword arguments are order independent.{{2}}


`@script`
Keyword arguments are an alternative way to pass arguments to function calls. Here, we use the parameter names followed by the assignment operator and the argument value in the function call.
Unlike positional arguments, keyword arguments are order independent.


---
## Example: Keyword Arguments

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "8e7fa6ef8e"
```

`@part1`
```python
# Function definition remains unchanged from before
# Print the arguments passed into the function
def print_arg(a, b):
   print("The value of a is: " + str(a))
   print("The value of b is: " + str(b))
```{{1}}

```python
# Call print_arg using keyword arguments
print_arg(a="Cat", b=5)
```{{2}}

```
Output:
The value of a is: Cat
The value of b is: 5
```{{3}}

```python
# Change the order in which arguments are passed
print_arg(b="Adams", a=42)
```{{4}}

```
Output:
The value of a is: 42
The value of b is: Adams
```{{5}}


`@script`
To illustrate keyword arguments, we will use the same print_arg function definition as before.
What changes here however, is the function call. Instead of passing in the values in order, we pass in the parameter name followed by the assignment operator and the associated argument.
The output we get is expected. a is mapped to the value 'Cat' and b is mapped to 5.
As mentioned earlier, keyword arguments are order independent. Let us change the order and the values passed. Again, we get the intuitive output. a is mapped to 42 whereas b is mapped to Adams.


---
## Default Arguments

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "ece0e00c57"
```

`@part1`
- Also known as optional arguments.{{1}}
- Allows function arguments to have default values.{{2}}
- If the function call occurs without the default argument, it gets its default value.{{3}}
- Default arguments are defined in the function definition using the assignment operator(=). {{4}}


`@script`
The arguments that we've seen so far were required arguments. In other words, the function call would throw an error if we didn't pass them.
However, Python makes it possible to introduce optional arguments into our functions that have default values.
If the function call occurs without the default argument, it gets its default value.
Default arguments are defined in the function definition using the assignment operator(=).


---
## Example: Default Arguments

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "afe9c4098b"
```

`@part1`
```python
# Modify print_arg to include a default value for parameter b
def print_arg(a, b=100):
   print("The value of a is: " + str(a))
   print("The value of b is: " + str(b))
```{{1}}

```python
# Call print_arg without passing an argument for b
print_arg("Ball")
```{{2}}

```
Output:
The value of a is: Ball
The value of b is: 100
```{{3}}

```python
# Call print_arg and override the default value of b
print_arg(a ="Dice", b=96)
```{{4}}

```
Output:
The value of a is: Dice
The value of b is: 96
```{{5}}


`@script`
In this example, we modify the print_arg function in such a way that b becomes a default parameter.
When print_arg is called with only one parameter, b assumes the default value of 100.
When print_arg is called with all parameters, b takes the value which is assigned in the function call.

## A Practical Use Case: Seaborn Bar Plots

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "3326cf2651"
disable_transition: false
```

`@part1`

`@script`
Default and keyword arguments are central to any third-party function that you may use; especially as a data scientist.
It isn't uncommon to deal with functions that have over twenty parameters in their definition. Consider, seaborn's barplot function which allows us to plot a bar graph. 
While calling this function, we usually want to pass in only some parameters. This is made possible by default and keyword arguments. Usually, almost all the parameters in third party functions such as barplot are given default values. In this way, the user can use keyword arguments to only pass in those arguments that are necessary for a particular use-case.

## A Practical Use Case: Seaborn Bar Plots

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "c75353985f"
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`
```python
seaborn.barplot(x="day", y="total_bill", data=tips, hue='sex')
```{{1}}

![](https://seaborn.pydata.org/_images/seaborn-barplot-2.png){{2}}


`@script`
Here, we see the seaborn.barplot function being called using only 4 parameters which are not in order. The existence of default and keyword arguments makes this possible.

## Let's practice!

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "52461ae691"
```

`@script`
That's enough theory for now. Let us now check if we have understood the concepts explored in this video through a few practice exercises.
